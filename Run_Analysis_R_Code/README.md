Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This rep represents my effort regarding getting and cleaning data course project offered online by Coursera. The sumbssion contains 
contains three files codebook.md, run_anlaysis.R and readme.md.  Also included in this repo is a tidy dataset called accelerometer_data.csv.  

The codebook.md file describes: 
the variables contained in the dataset, 
the data manipulation steps and methods employed in creading the tidy dataset.

The run_analysis.R contains the R script I wrote to perform the following tasks.
1) loads the orignalal data sets into the R console
2) merges the orginal data sets into a single file
3) formats and coerces selected data files for data manipulation
4) subsets the combined orignal dataset with selected varialbs labelled mean and std.
5) performs data aggregation to create mean values using activity and subject fields as group by variables
6) finally creates and writes a tidy dataset called accelerometer_data.csv.
